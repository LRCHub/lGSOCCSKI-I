Ok Ok Ok Aye
Tokyo drifting

Come to the city
And we do it different
I'm in,
Tokyo drifting

Come to the city
And see why we different
Do it up
Do it up

Rewind
Full gas when I get that Green light
On track for the big one
Look where we are
Raisin the bar
Get in the car
Swerving OUT Taking off I'm like -
ギア6でも足りない
Signature plates 吹かすV8
踏まないブレーキ you know when I roll
0 to 100
Go for gold
That's how it goes That's how it goes
Imma race it imma
Say I never ever loss
never ever loss
Now you know I'm taking off
Imma race it imma
Say I never ever loss
Now you know I'm taking off
Imma make it
Imma take it
Aye
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Come to the city
And we do it different
I'm in,
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Come to the city
And see why we different
Pull up to the spot
Put me at the top
I could make it rain
With the aftershock
Betする全部
with my 友達
If I'm on the way
You know it's a lock
Uh
Pedal straight down to the metal like
Uh
city から cityへと飛び立つ
Got the whole crowd talking bout it like
Look look look look
Turned it to eleven
Think they got the message
I could keep them guessing
Got em at attention
I'll be teaching lessons
I'll be making messes
羽田から羽を広げて
(Come on)
Imma race it imma
Say I never ever loss
Now you know I'm taking off
Imma make it
Imma take it
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Come to the city
And we do it different
I'm in,
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Tokyo drifting
Come to the city
And see why we different
Tokyo Drifting, Doing it different ooh yeah
I want that red line tension
Ain't got no fear in the glow
I'm here to put on a show
'bout to set a new time
Konichiwa
Imma race it imma
Say I never ever loss

Now you know I'm taking off
Tokyo drifting
